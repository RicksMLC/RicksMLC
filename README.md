# Rick's MLC Contracts for Getting Started with kOS
These are some custom contracts which can be used to get to know kOS from inside the Kerbal Space Program Contracts system.

Usage:
    Install these under the Kerbal Space Program/GameData/RicksMLC directory.
    Start KSC, and they contracts should appear once you have the kOS hardware unlocked in R & D.

Some example kOS scripts can be found in the other repository:
